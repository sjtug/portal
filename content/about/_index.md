SJTUG's a Joyful Techie User Group in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://sjtu.edu.cn). Topics will range over projects, techniques, resources, problems, cool ideas, or just any cool stuff relevant to technology. Discussions and talks take in the form of traditional [Linux User Groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_user_group) that involves mailing lists and meet-ups. Hacking Thursday is our primary on-campus event since 2013 that we meet once a week for round table discussions. SJTUG is non-profit and absolutely free. All you need is curiosity and a passion for cool technologies.
